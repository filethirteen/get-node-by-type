# get-node-by-type
A Godot addon that allows you to fetch nodes by type instead of name. Also can auto populate @export variables via a custom inspector button.

Allows you to fetch the first Node by class_name or native script name instead of 
by name or an array of Nodes by class_name or native script name.

Registers an autoload singleton called "Get" and provides a custom inspector addition that applies 
to all Nodes with a script attached.
You can utilize 2 functions provided in Get which are:
Get.node_by_type(searchRoot: Node, type_ref, recursive: bool = false)
Get.nodes_by_type(searchRoot: Node, type_ref, recursive: bool = false)

This provides an alternative to:
- Using @export and assigning references via the inspector which requires manually connecting 
	scripts together in the inspector. 
- Fetching nodes by path which is too flimsy to consider for real usage. 
- Access by unique name which requires extra clicks to create unique names each time you want to 
	use them.
- Using Node.find_children() directly because it is clunky to use inline in places where
	you just want to fetch a single instance of a Node such as in your @onready or _ready(). 
	Additionally find_children() only accepts strings for the type, not the class directly.

It can be used with @onready to provide references to other nodes regardless of name. Much like 
get_node(), you should avoid using these in process functions and you should cache the results 
as the recursive versions can be quite heavy to process. Best to utilize in the same way you 
use get_node(), primarily for initialization.

Finally this adds a button to the inspector for any Node with a script attached which automatically 
assigns references by type using the above Get Node By Type functionality. This allows you to just
@export any type you want and not have to manually assign references as long as you only want to
grab the first reference of a specific type.
